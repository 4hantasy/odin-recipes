                    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
                    <li>¼ cup oyster sauce</li>
                    <li>1 container of fully cooked spam</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>5 sheets sushi nori</li> 
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; drain and rinse.</li>
                    <li>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside to cool.</li>
                    <li>Stir together sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a medium bowl until sugar is completely dissolved. Slice luncheon <br>meat lengthwise into 10 slices, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook slices until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
                    <li>Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface. Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, and press rice tightly inside. Top <br>with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press. Wrap nori around rice, sealing edges with a small amount of water. <br>(Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices and about 1-inch thick.)</li>
                    <li>Serve musubi warm or chilled.</li>
            </ol>
