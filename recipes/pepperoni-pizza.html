            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
                <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, <br>sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; <br>mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, <br>a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. <br>(If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
                <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
                <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between <br>the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
            </ol>
